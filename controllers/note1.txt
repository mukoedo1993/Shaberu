Hi Nicolas,

I am having the same issue.  Here's what I found.

Using Compass I noted that the _id that is stored as a foreign key in the post document does not have a corresponding record (document) in the users file.  Therefore the lookup is not returning anything thus the empty authorDocument.

To prove my point, I manually updated the author field in my post document to equal the _id that I copy pasted from it's record(document) in the users file.  Now when I execute the single-post page I am returning a valid authorDocument as expected.

So I asked myself why am I getting a bogus _id in the users file?  So I looked at the userController where the original user document is created and guess what I found:

In both the login AND register functions i had:

req.session.user = {avatar: user.avatar, username: user.data.username, _id: user._id}

instead of:

req.session.user = {avatar: user.avatar, username: user.data.username, _id: user.data._id}

So I fixed the file, deleted all documents from both the users and posts files, put up a new user then a new post and voila, tout va bien.

Now there's no guarantee that your error is the same as mine but if you follow my debugging path you might be able to pinpoint your problem.

Hope this helps.
