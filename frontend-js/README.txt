Target for this folder:
To make our code more organized.

Within each of our modules file, we want to export code that our main.js file can import. Then we can
set up a automation tool that can bundle up each main.js imports. And, it would create a file that would be automatically
placed in our public folder.

frontend-js: source file <-- as organized as possible. But one big messy file still ends up in public folder that our 
broswer can actually download from.
